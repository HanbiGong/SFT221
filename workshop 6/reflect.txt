1. Did you find more bugs using the log file or assertions? Why did one work better than the other?

-> Using a log file was more helpful. A log file records different code records and conditions that happen during a program's run. It gives useful information for finding bugs. For example, in a given log file, I found "whitespace" in the "WARN" level logs. This could show issues with handling blank spaces in the program. By debugging this, we can fix the bug. So, log files provide detailed information that helps in discovering and understanding bugs and it also making debugging process effective. Also, log files serve as a historical record, so it allows developers to make a records the sequence of events leading up to a bug, aiding in its resolution. Moreover, log files facilitate collaboration among team members by providing a shared understanding of the program's behavior.

2. Do you like to debug using log files or the debugger? Why do you prefer one over the other? Can you envision a situation where you would only be able to use log files? Would you be able to debug as well? Would you be able to debug at the same speed as using a debugger, slower or faster?

-> Log files are useful because they keep a record of what happened, making it easier to find errors. For example, in your log, "ERROR: Unable to connect to database" clearly indicates a problem with the database connection. However, finding errors in logs can take a long time, especially in large log files. If I want to locate specific debugging information for a particular function, it might be challenging to find it. Additionally, logs may not contain all the necessary details to solve a problem; they only provide the outcome.If I only have log files for debugging, I can still identify and resolve issues, but it may take longer compared to using a debugger.

3. How did you gain confidence that you had found all the bugs? Would you bet your life savings that you found all the bugs? If not, what would you do so that you would feel comfortable betting that you had found all the bugs?

-> This question brings a smile to my face. I try on both log files and debugging to find out bugs. By using both ways, I believe I've identified all the bugs, but I wouldn't bet my savings on it. As a student, my bug-finding skills are still developing, so my results may not be perfect. I find debugging more challenging than coding itself. When I write code, I follow familiar patterns and fix errors easily. However, debugging others' code is trickier as I'm not as familiar with it. Thus, debugging poses a greater challenge for me, but it's a valuable learning experience.
